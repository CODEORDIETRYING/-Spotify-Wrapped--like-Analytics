# Marketing Campaign Case Study - Similar to Spotify Wrapped.
>A marketing campaign case study that uses user data to increase email open rate and engagement for a ficticious dvd rental company called LetFlix (sounds original to me)! This case study showcases my understanding of SQL and is a part of the Serious SQL course by [Danny Ma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datawithdanny/)

## üéû Introduction
As humans, we like to feel special and not get lost in the crowd, even if an experience is a general one. Every digital marketer and business lead/owner knows how important it is to send out emails that are engaging and can get customers to take action. One tested way to engage customers is by sending personalized emails. Personalized customer emails based off user analytics are a great way for consumer-facing digital companies to connect with their audience and increase user engagement via mail. 

In this case study, I am going to be making use of SQL to leverage customer data of a fictitious movie rental company in order to send out personalized emails that engage customers and make them feel special, let‚Äôs call this company ‚ÄúLetflix‚Äù - sounds very original right? 
The operations in this case study can be applied elsewhere regardless of the industry and use case, but it is best suited for consumer-facing businesses. Special shout out to [Danny Ma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datawithdanny/) for this [SQL Bootcamp](https://www.datawithdanny.com/) course. Hands down the best dollar I have ever spent learning data analytics with SQL. Let's head over to the case study problem!

## üé¨ Problem
The marketing team at Letflix has decided to launch their first-ever personalized marketing campaign as a strategy to engage customers and recommend new movies to them. One of the challenges they face is getting access to the necessary data points needed to populate specific parts of the email campaign. Most of the companies user data is stored within multiple tables in a relational database. To this end, they have reached out to the data team (me, myself, and I) with a draft of the email template to be sent out, in order to analyze the company‚Äôs database and come up with a single table that is much easier for them to use.

## üö¶ Requirements
The marketing team has shared a draft template of the email campaign intended to be sent out to all customers. This serves as a guide for the data team.

##  üõ∞ Data Exploration
The data needed for analysis are stored in 7 different tables. To make the dataset easy to visualize and link all foreign keys to one another, each table and respective columns have been properly visualized in an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) using [dbdiagram.io.](https://dbdiagram.io)

## 5. üî¨ Reverse Engineering
To determine what tables and columns we are going to be working with, we need to start from the end result (email template) and walk our way to the needed tools (in this case data fields) we are going to be working with. Our overall end result for this analysis is being able to populate the email template as shown by the marketing team, so we are going to be using that.

## 6. üîó Table Joining
The rental table determines a lot in this analysis because it gives us information on each film rental which is what we want to analyze, but the rental table only shows us unique rental (rental_id), customer information (customer_id) and item rented (inventory_id). We do not know anything about the film in particular that was rented out as well as the film category. To know the category of the rented movie, we need to find a way to join the rental table to the category table. 

**We can do this by following these steps:**

- Step 1: Starting with the dvd_rental.Rental table, use the foreign key (inventory_id) to join it to the inventory table
- Step 2: Join the new table from step 1 to dvd_rental.film to get the film titles. The foreign key for the join is the film_id column
- Step 3: Join the dvd_rental.film table to the dvd_rental.film_category table on the film_id column
- Step 4: Finally join the previous table to the dvd_rental.category table on the category_id column serving as a foreign key

## 8. üíΩ Solution
To simplify things for the marketing team, I generated a single lookup table for them to consume. Each row/data entry in the lookup table is associated with a single customer.

I made use of multiple CTEs to perform the transformation from long to wide. Also, I used the CONCAT function to concatenate strings and column inputs.
